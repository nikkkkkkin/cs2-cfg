## :hammer_and_wrench: How to

1. Download the ZIP archive of the repository.
2. Put contents of archive into the game's cfg folder.
```
\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg
```

> [!TIP]
> Default path is:
>```
> C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg
>```

3. After this you will have access to some config functions, such as `knives`, `cross`, `-tr` and aliases. Use `info` to see full list of commands.
4. To fully use of config, use `exec mira`.

> [!WARNING]
> Your settings will be overwritten!

5. If you see the info screen, then you have succeeded.
